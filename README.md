# Chatter - Chat application 
This project is a chat application that is modeled after the popular messaging app, WhatsApp. The application is designed to provide users with a seamless messaging experience and includes various features such as notifications, message history. The application utilizes a separation of concerns approach, with distinct layers for models, routes, and public resources.

The models layer is responsible for handling the data and business logic of the application. It defines the structure of the data and implements the functionality for storing and retrieving information from the database.

The routes layer is responsible for handling the application's routing and URL handling. It directs incoming requests to the appropriate controllers and handles the responses that are sent back to the client.

The public layer is responsible for managing the application's public resources such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Overall, this project aims to provide a robust and user-friendly chat application with a clear separation of concerns, enabling easy maintenance and scalability.
